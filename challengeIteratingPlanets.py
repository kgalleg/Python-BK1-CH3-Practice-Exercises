# Create another list containing tuples. Each tuple will hold the name of a spacecraft that we have launched, and the names of the planet(s) that it has visited, or landed on.
# # Example spacecraft list

spacecraft = [
   ("Cassini", "Saturn"),
   ("Viking", "Mars"),
]

# Iterate over your list of planets, and inside that loop, iterate over the list of tuples. Print, for each planet, which satellites have visited it.
